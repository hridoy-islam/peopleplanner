I enjoy going for short walks, visiting coffee shops, and participating in light shopping, as this helps me stay connected and reduce feelings of isolation. I also need my daily routine to be consistent, calm, and structured, especially because I struggle with anxiety, confusion, and sleep issues. I value the close relationship I have with my family, particularly my daughters, sons and husband, who play a central role in my care and wellbeing. Building trust and maintaining a calm, familiar routine are key to helping me feel secure, especially during times when my mental health symptoms are heightened.',
